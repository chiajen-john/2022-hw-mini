# HW Miniproject Report

[modified_pwm_led_fade.c](./modified_pwm_led_fade.c) contains the modified version of pwm_led_fade.c. The program is changed such that the variable fade increases faster, which results in faster blinking periods. We rewrote the code, recompiled with cmake, and uploaded the binary to rasberry pico. The video demontration can be found [here](./modified_pwm_led_fade.mov).
