# HW Miniproject Report

[modified_pwm_led_fade.c](./modified_pwm_led_fade.c) contains the modified version of pwm_led_fade.c. The program is changed such that the variable fade increases faster (plus 5 instead of plus one), which results in faster blinking periods. We rewrote the code, recompiled it with cmake, and uploaded the binary to Rasberry Pi pico. We have a machine with MAC OS, so the environment setup step was all done using homebrew. The video demonstration can be found [here](./modified_pwm_led_fade.mov). The unmodified code video demonstration can be found [here](./pwm_led_fade.mov).
